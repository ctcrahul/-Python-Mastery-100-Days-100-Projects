"""
AI TIME LEAK DETECTOR
---------------------
This system analyzes user work behavior patterns and detects:

- Focus quality
- Time waste
- Productivity patterns
- Burnout signals

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Simulates activity data (replace later with real tracking)
2. Calculates behavioral metrics
3. Uses ML to predict productivity
4. Detects time leaks via anomaly detection
5. Generates behavioral insights

This is behavioral AI, not just classification.
